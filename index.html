        <h3>By Dennis Overbye</h3>
        <h6>March 17, 2014</h6>
        <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young <br> physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s <br> appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and <br> equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics. <br><br>

            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic <br> particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he <br> discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. <br> A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could <br> have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a <br> repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed <br> of light for a prodigiously violent instant. <br><br>
            
            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the <br> heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, <br> warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the <br> wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but <br> would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean. <br><br>
            
            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of <br> the page and drew a double box around it. <br>
            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers <br> reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that <br> his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right. <br><br>

        <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic <br> time</a> with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led <br> by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for <br> Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so- <br> called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe being <br> wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a <br> trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought <br> smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his <br> colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct. <br><br>
           Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though <br> many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be <br> proved. <br><br>
            
            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in <br> science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing <br> the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast <br> realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation. <br><br>
            
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, <br> extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of <br> billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos <br> whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, <br> beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of <br> other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta <br> water boiling over.</p> <br>
    <article>
            <h3>‘As Big as It Gets’</h3>
        <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces <br> operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle <br> accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. <br> Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of <br> gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of <br> general relativity, should ruffle space-time. <br><br>

            Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early- <br> universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, <br> as big as it gets.” <br><br>
            
            He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, <br> sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.” <br><br>
            
            The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath <br> of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a <br> picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as <br> the surface of the sun. <br>
            
            Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known <br> as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic <br> Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the <br> Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers <br> submitted to The Astrophysical Journal. <br>

            <h4>The Theory of Inflation</h4>
            <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the <br> instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>
